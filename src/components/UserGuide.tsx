          The app harnesses the power of AI to assist users in interacting with
          and understanding PDF documents. To utilize the app, follow these
          simple steps:
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside font-semibold">
            <li>
              Upload your PDF file to the platform and give the system a moment
              to process it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once processed, you can engage in a chat-like interface where you
              can ask specific questions about the content of your document.
            </li>
            <li>
              The AI will analyze your query and provide responses based on the
              information contained within your PDF.
            </li>
          </ol>
          This interactive approach allows for a more intuitive understanding of
          complex documents, saving time and enhancing productivity.
